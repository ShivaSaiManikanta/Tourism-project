<p><h2>WHY YOU SHOULD VISIT MUMBAI??</h2>
<span style="color:#FDFEFE";font-weight:bolder">With its lovely chaotic streets, impressive colonial buildings, and vibrant atmosphere, Mumbai is definitely something you should see with your own eyes.
 This is a city where fine dining restaurants stand side by side with crowded street food stalls, and swanky fashion boutiques share space with colorful bazaars.
Mumbai is the second-most populous city in India after Delhi and the eighth-most populous city in the world with a population of roughly 2 crore.</span></p>
